Helps you practice your ear for recognising and playing guitar chords.

TODOs

- Add some kind of automatic hands-free mode (time delay?)
- Allow for repeating the new chord x number of times when new one is introduced
- Allow for using microphone and detecting if right chord is played, moving on automatically if so (maybe..)
- Allow for practicing multiple chords in a row (simon says mode)
- Allow for infinite repeating of a series of chords to allow for practicing melodies
- Remember settings
- Style the app
